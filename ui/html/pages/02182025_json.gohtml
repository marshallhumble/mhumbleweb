<h1>Modern Password Policies: Why Common Password Policies Fail and What Works Better</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Passwords remain the primary method of authentication, but outdated password policies often lead to security risks
    and user frustration.</p>

<p>I work with a lot og government and healthcare customers, and time and time again I see almost the same password
    policies or a minor variation of the formula:
<ul>
    <li>8-16 characters</li>
    <li>1 lower, 1 upper case character</li>
    <li>1 number and 1 special character</li>
    <li>Max expiration 60 days</li>
    <li>Copy/paste disabled in form fields</li>
</ul>
<p>This is often driven by larger customers, smaller companies doing business with larger customers will often align
    policies so that security questions/vendor audits can be met.
</p>

<h2>Why These Common Password Policies Can Compromise Security</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Overly Complex Requirements Lead to Weak Passwords:</strong> Users create predictable passwords like
        <code>P@ssword1!</code>, which attackers can guess easily. (I even see this when security teams create
        passwords for vendors)</li>
    <li><strong>Frequent Expiration Encourages Reuse:</strong> Changing passwords every 60-90 days results in minor
        variations that attackers can predict.</li>
    <li><strong>Arbitrary Length Limits Are Harmful:</strong> Restricting passwords to 8-16 characters prevents the
        use of more secure passphrases.</li>
    <li><strong>Not Addressing Credential Reuse:</strong> Users commonly reuse passwords across multiple sites,
        increasing the risk of credential stuffing attacks.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliance on User Behavior Instead of System Enforcement:</strong> Without MFA, even strong passwords
        remain vulnerable to phishing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Works Better: Modern Password Policy Best Practices and New NIST Guidelines</h2>

<p>The current draft of <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html">NIST 800-63B Guidance</a> has some
    changes that break away from these traditional policies</p>

<p>Here is the password guidance listed on the DRAFT of 800-63B, as of this writing (may change):</p>

<h3>3.1.1.1. Password Authenticators</h3>

<p>Passwords <b>SHALL</b> either be chosen by the subscriber or assigned randomly by the CSP.</p>

<p>If the CSP disallows a chosen password because it is on a blocklist of commonly used, expected, or compromised values
(see Sec. 3.1.1.2), the subscriber <b>SHALL</b> be required to choose a different password. Other complexity
requirements for passwords <b>SHALL NOT</b> be imposed. A rationale for this is presented in Appendix A,
Strength of Passwords.</p>

<h3>Password Verifiers</h3>
<p>The following requirements apply to passwords:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHALL require passwords to be a minimum of eight characters in length and SHOULD require
        passwords to be a minimum of 15 characters in length.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD permit a maximum password length of at least 64 characters.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD accept all printing ASCII [RFC20] characters and the space character in passwords.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHOULD accept Unicode [ISO/ISC 10646] characters in passwords. Each Unicode code point SHALL
        be counted as a single character when evaluating password length.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHALL NOT impose other composition rules (e.g., requiring mixtures of different character
        types) for passwords.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHALL NOT require users to change passwords periodically. However, verifiers SHALL force a
        change if there is evidence of compromise of the authenticator.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHALL NOT permit the subscriber to store a hint that is accessible to an unauthenticated
        claimant.</li>
    <li>Verifiers and CSPs SHALL NOT prompt subscribers to use knowledge-based authentication (KBA) (e.g.,
        “What was the name of your first pet?”) or security questions when choosing passwords.</li>
    <li>Verifiers SHALL verify the entire submitted password (i.e., not truncate it).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Let's look more in depth to the why of the above</h2>

<p>First however I want to point out that there are 2 points to security. The technical control and the human aspect.</p>
<p>We often assume if we make a good enough technical control and ignore the person using it or implementing it then
everything will be ok. These new NIST changes are taking the human factor into account as well as the technical.</p>

<p>Many of these issues can be alleviated with a password manager. I HIGHLY suggest using one. Most of the major
    brands on the market pretty much do the same thing, and now they compete on extras. See what works for you. Try not
    to avoid using one the has been broken into multiple times, where the lead dev was running an unpatched
    Plex server on his development machine though...</p>

<h3>1. Enforce a Minimum Length but Encourage Passphrases</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Require at least <strong>13-17 characters</strong> and encourage passphrases
    like <em>"correct horse battery staple"</em>.</p>
<br>
<p>Why 12-18?<a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyberattacks-data-breaches/8-character-passwords-can-be-cracked-in-less-than-60-minutes">
        8 character passwords can be cracked in under 60 minutes</a> 7 character almost instantly. We don't start to get
into 'safe' territory until 13 characters with a mix upper and lower case, numbers, symbols and special character.
    For comparison that is 17 characters only using lower case.</p>
<p>Granted in this example there is only 1 gpu in use, using brcrypt and time can be reduced to a point, but the lowest
    'green' value is 11 <i>Billion</i> years for time to crack.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Force unnecessary complexity rules.</p>
<p>This is where we need to consider the human. The above control works great from a technical standpoint, but if it is
too burdensome for users to use then they will find shortcuts.</p>
<br>
<p>The more complex we make the rules for password the likelihood that the password is written down, or on a sticky
    note on the monitor goes up exponentially. As a veteran who was taught to keep 'my head on a swivel', and someone
    who works in cybersecurity and is naturally curious I tend to pay attention to my environment.</p>
<br>
<p>I can personally recall many a customer facing office setting where there is a shared computer, and the staff has
just taped a password to the monitor. The use of shared accounts is of course another problem but the reason the staff
    can’t recall the password is that it is overly complex.</p>
<br>
<p>Without going too deep into the science of memory here I think we can all agree that a 17 letter passphrase is
    more memorable than say: <i>w?zN.4>3EGF(B;^MZ</i> granted when I only look at the technical controls I would
    vastly prefer the latter over a passphrase but we again, have to consider the human and find a balance between
    technical controls and usability.</p>
<br>
<p>Further people act in predictable ways, changing L to 7 or E to 3 for example or an A to @, capilizing the first
    letter, etc. Making these optional with a smart minimum length can increase security.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>2. Allow Longer Passwords and Support Password Managers</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Allow passwords up to <strong>64+ characters</strong> to accommodate password managers.</p>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Impose arbitrary length restrictions.</p>
<br>
<p>Amazingly there are many sites out there that will break if your password is too long. I find this all over, I can
generally guess that if the design of the sites looks a little dated and/or the industry is change adverse then
I can expect that a password longer than 16 will not work, and I will have to reset it to login.</p>
<br>
<p>Another part of supporting password managers is enabling copy and paste. The possibility of transcription
    error goes up massively when I must manually enter the password vs the password manager filling it or copying
    from the password manager.</p>
<br>
<p>This should include other data like bank information. Why should we enter that manually instead of copy + paste
    from the bank. Again, the possibility of error goes up when it is manual.</p>
<br>
<h3>3. Remove Unnecessary Expiration Policies</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Require password changes <strong>only if compromised</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Force expiration every 90 days without a valid reason.</p>
<br>
<p>New NIST guidelines are to not force a change. Many places have 60 or fewer days set for password change. This has
been shown to increase bad habits like writing down passwords, using weak passwords or rotating 1-2 letters to
'trick' the system into seeing it as a new password. The more painful we make this process, the more time users are going
to spend trying to get around it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>4. Ban Common and Compromised Passwords</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Check against a database of <strong>known breached credentials</strong>.</p>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Allow common passwords like <code>123456</code> or <code>password</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>Malicious actors use these as dictionaries to conduct attacks against systems. This can take some work to implement,
but many third party solutions can do it for you.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>5. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Require <strong>MFA wherever possible</strong> using authenticator apps or security keys.</p>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Rely solely on passwords.</p>
<br>
<p>Microsoft notes that accounts that have MFA 99% less likely to be hacked. However, that number doesn't really hold up
when we look at other sources.
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/stop-insanity-mfa-does-99-attacks-roger-grimes/">10-30%</a> is probably more
correct, and will go down as we see more and more creative ways groups use to get MFA tokens. Even with those numbers
    using MFA is still recommended.</p>
<p>Physical keys like FIDO compliant ones from various vendors are great (until a user looses one) phish resistant
    layer of security. Again we should look at what works best for our orgs.</p>
<br>
<h3>6. Encourage (or Require) a Password Manager</h3>
<p><span class="do">✅ Do:</span> Recommend password managers for <strong>generating and storing</strong> secure passwords.</p>
<p><span class="dont">❌ Don’t:</span> Expect users to remember multiple complex passwords.</p>
<br>
<p>I mentioned this above, companies should get this for their users. A spill or breach of information can be costly,
    for most organizations the offset of risk more than covers the price of a password manager.</p>
<br>
<p>Again do your research here, if you are considering FedRAMP, then the only option is Keeper at the moment.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion: Smarter Password Policies for Stronger Security</h2>
<p>Traditional password policies often <strong>do more harm than good</strong> by encouraging weak habits. Instead,
    focus on <strong>longer passphrases, checking against breached credentials, supporting password managers, and
         enforcing MFA</strong>.</p>
<p>By adopting these modern best practices, organizations can improve security without frustrating users, leading to
    better compliance and a stronger security posture.</p>
